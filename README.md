# Milnwee CMS

## A Fullstack CMS for Laravel 5.1

__Milnwee is still a WIP! Check the public todos below__

> A what now?

Milnwee is designed to be downloaded and used as the base of your project. You would clone a copy of Milnwee, run `artisan` commands to set things up, and then build your app on top of it.

> So what are it's main benefits? Why should I use it?

__Developer friendly, totally customisable__ - Milnwee isn't a huge monolith that you have to somehow force your business rules onto; it's the glue for your app's components. You define the models, the relationships, the logic. Milnwee ties everything together and makes the whole process smoother. By v1.0, I wan't the CRUD interface to be simple and intuitive enough that any non-technical client could use it with ease.
